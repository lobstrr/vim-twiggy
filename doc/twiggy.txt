This plugin is only available if compatible is not set and requires that you
have the |fugitive| plugin installed.


INTRODUCTION                                    *twiggy*

Maintain your bearings while working with git branches.


COMMANDS                                        *twiggy-commands*

:Twiggy [args]              With no arguments, open a split containing an
                            interactive and decorated list of branches. See
                            |twiggy-mappings| for a list of available
                            buffer-local mappings.

                            If [branch] is given, it will be checked-out -- If
                            the branch does not exist, it will be created
                            first.  In this regard, it acts like a cross between
                            the `git branch` and `git checkout` commands.  You
                            may also provide the starting point branch as a
                            second argument.


FUGITIVE COMPATIBILITY                         *twiggy-fugitive*
Twiggy is aware of the |fugitive| commands |:Gstatus|, |:Gcommit| and |:Gblame|.
Calling these within the twiggy buffer will first jump to the last used buffer
before running the actual commands.  This avoids a surprisingly claustrophobic
feeling while inside twiggy's buffer.  You may also opt to automatically close
twiggy when running these commands by setting:
>
  let g:twiggy_close_on_fugitive_command = 1
<


ICONS                                           *twiggy-icons*

As per standard git output, * is used to denote the current branch.  Branches
may also have secondary icons prepended to them which, for the most part, mean
they are tracking branches.  Here is the legend:

multi_byte    standard
✓             =             branch is in synch with its upstream
↑             -             branch is ahead of its upstream
↓             +             branch is behind of its upstream
↕             ~             branch is both ahead and behind its upstream
∅             %             branch is detached
✗             x             in merge/rebase state

You may also use you own icons by setting the following in your vimrc:
>
  let g:twiggy_icons = ['*', '=', '+', '-', '~', '%', 'x']
<
The list must have 7, single character entries.  The first position is used
for the current branch then the rest are in the order listed in the above
legend.


SORTING                                         *twiggy-sorting*

Twiggy can sort your branches.

Alpha-Numeric {alpha}       The standard one you are used to.

Most Recently Used {mru}    Using the reflog, twiggy will sort descending
                            in the order you checked out each branch.  This
                            isn't truly mru since if the branch isn't in the
                            reflog, it will sort near the bottom (new branches
                            or recently renamed branches, for example).

Tracking {track}            This sort puts tracking branches first followed by
                            local branches.  The two groups are sorted alpha-
                            numerically.  This is not available for remote
                            branches.

Committer Date {date}       Sort by the date of the last commit of each branch.


SORTING OPTIONS                                 *twiggy-sorting-options*

                                                *'local_branch_sort'*
Default 'alpha'
The default/current sort for local branches.  Values can be 'aplha', 'mru',
'date' or 'track'.
>
  let g:twiggy_local_branch_sort = 'mru'
<
                                                *'local_branch_sorts'*
This is the array of possible local branch sorts.  You can override it
directly if you want to limit the number of options available.  For example:
>
  let g:twiggy_local_branch_sorts = ['mru', 'date']
<
Legal values are the same as for |local_branch_sort|.

                                                *'remote_branch_sort'*

Default 'alpha'
The default/current sort for remote branches.  Values can be 'alpha'or
'date' .
>
  let g:twiggy_remote_branch_sort = 'date'
<
                                                *'remote_branch_sorts'*
As with |local_branch_sorts|, this an array of possible sorts to use.  This is
really just here for completeness;  It's pretty useless as there are only two
possible values.


GROUPING                                        *twiggy-grouping*

By default, twiggy groups branches via one level of "slash-nesting" for locals
and one group each for remotes.

Branches are sorted before they are grouped, so this can be a little odd when
sorting by MRU.  To sort locals as one unified group, use the |twiggy-a|
mapping (hint: it's a toggle).  You may set this grouping method to the
default with the following:
>
  let g:twiggy_group_locals_by_slash = 0
<


OTHER OPTIONS                                   *twiggy-options*

                                                *'num_columns'*
Default: 31
The width of Twiggy's buffer
>
  let g:twiggy_num_columns = 25
<
                                                *'split_method'*
Default: 'topleft'
The split method used to show the twiggy buffer.  Can be |leftabove|,
|rightbelow|, |topleft| or |botright|.
>
  let g:twiggy_split_method = 'botright'
<
Twiggy only allows a verticle split.

                                                *'set_upstream'*
Default: 1
Whether or not to automatically set the upstream the first time you push
a each branch.
>
  let g:twiggy_set_upstream = 0
<
                                                *'enable_quickhelp'*
Default: 1
Enables |twiggy-?| for quickhelp.  To turn it off:
>
  let g:twiggy_enable_quickhelp = 0


MAPPINGS                                        *twiggy-mappings*

                  Navigation~
                                                *twiggy-<C-N>*
<C-N>             Jump to the first branch of the next group

                                                *twiggy-<C-P>*
<C-P>             Jump to the first branch of the previous group

                                                *twiggy-<C-^>*
J                 Jump to the current branch

                  Sorting~
                                                *twiggy-i*
i                 Cycle through sorts of the group of the branch under the
                  cursor.  If on a remote, all remote groups will be sorted.

                                                *twiggy-I*
I                 Like i, but in reverse.


                                                *twiggy-gi*
gi                Cycle through sorts of groups other than that of the branch
                  under the cursor.  Useful for lazily resorting remote
                  branches without having to jump down to them.

gI                Like gi, but in reverse... even though there are only two
                  options.

                                                *twiggy-a*
a                 Toggle grouping of local branches with slashes (/) in their
                  names.

                  Checkout~
                                                *twiggy-c*
c                 Checkout the branch under the cursor.  If the branch is a
                  remote, create a tracking branch if one doesn't already
                  exist.

                                                *twiggy-C*
C                 Checkout the remote branch under the cursor in detached
                  HEAD.  If the branch is a local tracking branch, it will
                  checkout its remote in detached HEAD.

                                                *twiggy-<CR>*
<CR>              Same as c

                  ...and, for those of us used to the various plugins that use
                  o to open (which is kinda sorta almost like a checkout):

                                                *twiggy-o*
o                 Same as c

                                                *twiggy-O*
O                 Same as C

                  Fetching~
                                                *twiggy-f*
F                 Fetch the remote for the branch under the cursor.

                                                *twiggy-V*
V                 Pull the branch under the cursor.

                  Merging and Rebasing~
                                                *twiggy-m*
m                 Merge the branch under the cursor into the current branch.

                                                *twiggy-M*
M                 Merge the branch under the cursor's remote into the current
                  branch.  This is useful in conjunction with f.  For
                  example, place your cursor on a branch that isn't the
                  current one, press f to update its remote, then press M to
                  merge off the remote.

                                                *twiggy-r*
r                 Rebase the current branch off the branch under the cursor.

                                                *twiggy-R*
R                 Rebase the current branch off the branch under the
                  cursor's remote (if it has one).

                                                *twiggy-u*
                                                *twiggy-abort*
u                 Abort a merge or rebase

                  Pushing~
                                                *twiggy-^*
^                 Push the local branch under the cursor (think of it as an
                  upward arrow).  It will set the upstream if it's not
                  currently set--You can turn off this behaviour with:
                  >
                    let g:twiggy_set_upstream = 0
<
                                                *twiggy-g^*
g^                Prompt to specify the remote repo before pushing.

                  Deleting~
                                                *twiggy-dd*
dd                Delete the branch under the cursor.  If the branch isn't
                  fully merged, the prompt will warn you of this.  Press <CR>
                  or y to accept, press <Esc> or n to cancel.

                                                *twiggy-d^*
d^                If the branch under the cursor is remote, this will prompt
                  you to delete the branch off of the remote repo.  Since this
                  can be dangerous in the wrong hands, you have to turn this
                  mapping on with:
                  >
                    let g:twiggy_enable_remote_delete = 1
<

                  Stashing~
                                                *twiggy->>*
<<                `git stash`

                                                *twiggy-<<*
>>                `git stash pop`

                  The End~
                                                *twiggy-q*
q                 Quit

                                                *twiggy-Q*
Q                 Quit all twiggy buffers (including the error buffer)

                                                *twiggy-?*
?                 Open the quickhelp



EXPERIMENTAL CODE BLOAT                        *twiggy-cmd*

Pressing s while in the twiggy buffer will start a sort of command prompt that
looks like this:
>
  git <cmd>
<
You can use this prompt to pass a limited set of options to merge, rebase and
fetch mappings.

You can construct options with the following mappings:
>
  a: all
  f: ff
  !: force
  o: only
  s: squash
  t: tags
  n: no (prefix)
<
To finish the command, you may use any of the mappings for |fetch|, |merge|,
|rebase| and |push|.

For example, pressing snf would bring up the following:
>
  git <cmd> --no-ff
<
You could then complete the command by pressing m which would merge the branch
under the cursor into the current branch with the --no-ff option.

<C-U> and <C-W> work as expected while in this mode.

To abort, press any key that isn't a valid terminator mapping (r, R, m, M, f
or F).  I'd suggest <ESC>.

WARNING!  As implied by the header, this whole thing is more of a fun
experiment; At least for the time-being.  I don't use this a whole lot myself.
Also, IT DOES NO FORM OF VALIDATION.  So typing 'snor' is going to run 'git
rebase --only' or `git fetch --no-force` which are just wrong.


SYNTAX                                        *twiggy-syntax*

Twiggy provides a handful of syntax groups for your customization kicks.
Below is a list of these groups and their defaults.  To override any of these,
put something like the following in your vimrc:
>
  highlight TwiggyGroup ctermfg=10 guifg=#00FF00
  highlight link TwiggySortText Normal
<
TwiggyGroup                 Type         a group heading (normal, origin, ...)
TwiggySortText              Comment      sort indicator (beside the header)
TwiggyBranchStatus          DiffDelete   group name becomes 'rebasing' or
                                         'merging'
TwiggyCurrent               Identifier   name of the current branch
TwiggyNotInReflog           Comment      name of branches not in the reflog
TwiggyIconCurrent           Identifier   icon: generally the * character
TwiggyIconTracking          DiffAdd      icon: an up-to-date tracking branch
TwiggyIconAhead             DiffDelete   icon: branch is ahead of remote
TwiggyIconAheadBehind       DiffDelete   icon: branch is both ahead and behind
TwiggyIconDetached          DiffChange   icon: current branch is detached
TwiggyIconUnmerged          DiffDelete   icon: current branch is unmerged
